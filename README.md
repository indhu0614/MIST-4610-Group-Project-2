# NYC Air Quality Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes New York City's air quality surveillance data sourced from the US Data Gov website. The dataset provides insights into the relationship between air pollution and population density across NYC neighborhoods, covering air quality indicators, pollutant emissions, and health implications. The goal is to explore trends in air quality, particularly in the city's most populated boroughs.

## Dataset

The dataset, named "Air_Quality," provides comprehensive information on New York City's air quality. The key attributes include:

- **Air Quality Indicators**: Including pollutant levels and emissions.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Data is categorized by neighborhoods and boroughs.
- **Time Range**: The dataset covers data from 2016 to 2022.

For more details, the data can also be explored on the [Environment and Health Data Portal](http://nyc.gov/health/environmentdata).

## Questions Addressed

1. **Air Quality Levels in the Most Populated Boroughs in 2022:**
   - This analysis focuses on the top 5 most populated boroughs in NYC.
   - It examines air quality levels across these boroughs to understand the impact of population density on pollution levels.
   - This question is important because urban areas with higher populations often face greater pollution challenges, impacting public health.

2. **Air Quality Before and After COVID:**
   - The analysis compares air quality levels in the 5 most populated boroughs before and after COVID-19.
   - It aims to assess how the pandemic, which led to decreased vehicular and industrial activities, affected pollution levels.
   - This is significant for evaluating how changes in societal behavior can influence environmental health.

## Data Manipulations

To ensure focused and relevant analysis:

- The dataset was filtered to include only the top 5 most populated boroughs in NYC.
- Data from 2016 to 2022 was used to provide a meaningful time range for comparison.

## Analysis and Results
1. **Air Quality Levels in the Most Populated Boroughs in 2022:**
   - Based on the resutls, it was shown that the borough with the highest and worst air quality is Manhattan. Manhattan is also the most populated borough amongst the top 5 most populated boroughs in New York.
   - The order of top 5 boroughs with the worst air quality going from highest to lowest is: Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island.
   - The visualization showcases that areas with a higher population tend to have a larger amount of pollution, therefore, having a negative impact on public health.

2. **Air Quality Before and After COVID:**
   - The results show that the air quality levels before COVID-19 were much worse due constant pollution of cars, buses, and other forms of public transportation. After COVID-19, the air quality levels dropped tremendously due to the lockdowns.
   - Due to the pandemic, it was shown that the decrease in vehicular and industrial activities made  positive impact on the air quality levels. The pollution decreased and this demonstrates how societal behavior can influence environmental and public health.
